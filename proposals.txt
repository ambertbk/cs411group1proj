Proposals!

I. Do you keep forgetting when your favorite band is in town? Do you wish you were always free for your favorite musician to visit? Take a gander at our smart music calendar! Using your Spotify Top Artists (or input your favorite artist), location, and calendar, we populate your calendar (free of charge) with a few of your favorite artists events nearby! To do this, we'll be using the Spotify API, Google Calendar API, and the user's current location to minimize effort to create your FOMO-free schedule. Rain or shine? We'll give you our best guess to ensure your concert hair is looking good by integrating our weather API! Enjoy our currently nameless app to be pressured by your calendar to leave your house and party.


II. The time for relaxing has come. After setting up a secure account, in which you answer few questions about yourself, we tell where and when to vacation and what to do! You know that work will leave you with little to no time to have fun. What stresses you are the multitudes of choices for traveling which may end up regrettably boring and just aren't you. Why take all the trouble and risk your precious time when our software can make the choice for you! Based on user preference of weather, scenery, and destinations, we will use the weather API along with Yelp! API to find suitable holiday locations. Along with recommended places to visit (shops, restaurants etc...) at recommended times.
