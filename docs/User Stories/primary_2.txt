Another user story we will add the user able to filter the top artists they want to input into their calendar. The user will be able to choose from whom in their top artists they want to use populate their calendar. Using the Ticketmaster API, the user will also be able to filter the concerts of the artists via price, distance, etc. Filtering by price per artist makes it convenient as users might be willing to pay different amounts for different artists. We will also enable filtering by distance which would be done by radius in miles. We will include an option called any distance for people where distance isnâ€™t a factor the same for price would also be added.
