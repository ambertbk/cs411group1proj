Users will be able to modify their calendar after logging in and syncing concert data. For example, the user should be able to select old ones to delete, or change the maximum distance to include concerts from. They will also be able to perform another Spotify sync whenever they like, as their music preferences might have changed, and the new Spotify data should be compared against what already exists in the calendar using the database to prevent duplication.
