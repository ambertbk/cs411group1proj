Our group ended up going with Node.js/Javascript since two members of our group had taken/are currently taking CS400 and there is work being done with APIs there. Additionally, the other members of our group felt comfortable picking Javascript. We had considered at the beginning of the project to do Python since everyone knew Python, but were unable to figure out how to instantiate Python/Flask before other team members had gotten the skeleton live for our prototype in Node.
